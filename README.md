Please refer to the provided design above as a guide for your implementation. Your goal is to create a functional todo list application that closely resembles this design. Key points to note:

1. The application should have a clean, centered layout with a white background and subtle shadow.
2. Include an input field for adding new todos, along with an "Add" button.
3. Implement filter buttons for "All", "Active", and "Completed" todos.
4. Each todo item should display the todo text and have buttons for completing, editing, and deleting the todo.
5. Completed todos should have a strikethrough effect.
6. Use appropriate spacing and styling to ensure good readability and user experience.

Note: While matching the exact design is not crucial, aim to create a clean and functional user interface that incorporates all the required features.
