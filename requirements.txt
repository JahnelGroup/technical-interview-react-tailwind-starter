You are tasked with creating a simple todo list application using React. Please implement the following features:

1. Display a list of todo items
2. Add new todo items
3. Delete todo items
4. Mark todo items as completed
5. Filter todo items (All, Active, Completed)
6. Implement basic styling to match the provided design

Bonus features (if time allows):

7. Edit existing todo items
8. Persist todos in local storage
9. Implement basic form validation (e.g., prevent empty todos)

## Design Requirements

1. The application should have a clean, centered layout with a white background and subtle shadow.
2. Include an input field for adding new todos, along with an "Add" button.
3. Implement filter buttons for "All", "Active", and "Completed" todos.
4. Each todo item should display the todo text and have buttons for completing, editing, and deleting the todo.
5. Completed todos should have a strikethrough effect.
6. Use appropriate spacing and styling to ensure good readability and user experience.

Note: While matching the exact design is not crucial, aim to create a clean and functional user interface that incorporates all the required features.
